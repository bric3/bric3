    <blockquote>In the story of this blog I used WordPress, and using the WordPress comments&lt;br&gt;then moved to Discus as it was better at handling spam. Then I switched this&lt;br&gt;blog to GitHub with first Jekyll with markdown then finally to Hugo, this worked&lt;br&gt;well enough. Then lately I’ve been a bit more displeased by the Disqus editing&lt;br&gt;capability &lpar;no markdown &lpar;or asciidoc&rpar; support, no preview&rpar;. More people&lt;br&gt;tend to have a GitHub account than a Disqus account &lpar;for tech blogs&rpar;.&lt;br&gt;Also, GitHub introduced GitHub Discussions which was appealing to use with blogs.&lt;br&gt;</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Linux 5.14 brought a new system call &lt;code&gt;memfd_secret&lt;/code&gt; in order to mitigate speculative attack by preventing the kernel from being able to peek at these memory segments. Let’s use this syscall from the JVM with the JEP-419 API.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>JDK 17 is coming and with the incubating JEP-412, let’s have a practical look at this API that should supersede JNI.</blockquote>  

- 2021-02-20 : [**A practical look at JEP-389 in JDK16 with libsodium**](https://blog.arkey.fr/2021/02/20/a-practical-look-at-jep-389-in-jdk16-with-libsodium/)

    <blockquote>&lt;em&gt;This entry has been marinating for most of the year 2020. I should have published&lt;br&gt;this opinion way earlier maybe end of 2019, but it took me time to realise I should split&lt;br&gt;a bigger piece in smaller articles that hopefully made sense on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;</blockquote>  

- 2020-10-23 : [**Reads network addresses in /proc**](https://blog.arkey.fr/2020/10/23/read-network-addresses-in-procfs/)  
    <blockquote>If you happen to be on a read only container that doesn’t have the usual network utilities,&lt;br&gt;like &lt;code&gt;netstat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ss&lt;/code&gt; &lpar;socket stat&rpar;, &lt;code&gt;lsof&lt;/code&gt;, etc then your only option is to leverage procfs,&lt;br&gt;however procfs displays some data in hexadecimal.&lt;br&gt;</blockquote>
